Snakemake pipeline to automatically download datasets and format them properly, specifically for TMT11 datasets.
This pipeline carries out the following steps:

    rule create_filedirs_annotations:
        - Creates a folder for each of the whole proteome plexes and their annotation file

    rule create_dirs:
      (All required software and files in this step must be present in the specified paths.)
        - Creates folder named bin for software tools to be used (MSFragger, Philosopher and TMTIntegrator)
        - Creates a folder named params for the parameters file
        - Creates a folder named database for the protein sequence FASTA file


    rule parameter_file:
        - Modifies the parameter file as desired

    rule filelinks:
      (PDC provides downloadable links for every mzML file available. These links can be downloaded
      in a csv file. This file also contains other information which can be left out.)
        - Extracts all downloadable links from the csv file and writes it to 'filelinks.txt'

    rule get_files:
        - Downloads all links in 'filelinks.txt'
        - Removes unnecessary extensions from downloaded mzML files
        - Unzips all mzML files

    rule move_mzML:
        - Moves mzML to its corresponding proteome plex directory


First, the first two rules need to be ran separately with the following commands:
snakemake -d [Cancer type]_philosopher create_filedirs_annotations
snakemake -d [Cancer type]_philosopher create_dirs

Second, the last rules will be run with the following command:
snakemake -d [Cancer type]_philosopher
